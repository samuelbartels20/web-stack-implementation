# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

What is the software development life cycle?
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model and Agile model.
- Waterfall Model: This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.
- Agile Model: The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
- Spiral Model: The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is like the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.

### How the SDLC Works
SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.

Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you must ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.

### Benefits of the SDLC
SDLC done right can allow the highest level of management control and documentation. Developers understand what they should build and why. All parties agree on the goal upfront and see a clear plan for arriving at that goal. Everyone understands the costs and resources required.

Several pitfalls can turn an SDLC implementation into more of a roadblock to development than a tool that helps us. Failure to consider the needs of customers and all users and stakeholders can result in a poor understanding of the system requirements at the outset. The benefits of SDLC only exist if the plan is followed faithfully.

### LAMP stack
LAMP is known for its free and open-source approach to back-end development. It has Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP. Besides PHP, developers can also use Python and Perl as an alternative.

Developers choose the LAMP stack because of ease of deployment and customization. Also, it has large community support that can cater to any types or kinds of web applications. Not to mention, it works as an alternative to costly software packages and enterprises.

As a result, it is the most popular architecture on the web. LAMP architecture is behind widely known Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Therefore, if you are working with one of these popular CMS, you are using the LAMP stack on your Virtual Private Server (VPS) or dedicated server.

### LAMP’s Architecture
- Linux: Linux is the operating system and sits as the first layer of the LAMP stack. It is the backbone, as all other components run on top of it. Also, the programming language and database management used in developing an application must coincide with what platform to use. In this case, PHP, and MySQL work efficiently with Linux. On the other hand, SQL, ASP.NET, and ASP are better suited to Windows. Linux has an extensive worldwide user base that extends across different industries. Although developers can work with the rest of the stack components on different operating systems, Linux still dominates because of its flexibility and easy configuration options compared to other operating systems.
- Apache: Apache web server is the most widely used server in the world. It serves more than half of the websites on the Internet. Apache offers extensive support with its well-developed community. It works using the HTTP to process requests and send information over the Internet. Developers choose Apache for its mature and feature-rich ecosystem. Although there are other entrants such as NGINX, the choice depends on the application’s requirements. 
- MySQL: The third layer of the LAMP stack is the MySQL database. It is an open source relational database management system that stores application data. With MySQL, it stores all the information in a format that is easily queried using the SQL language. SQL language works well with a structured business domain. Also, MySQL is robust and proven suitable for running large and complex websites. It supports SQL and relational tables. By doing so, it enables developers to build dynamic enterprise-level databases.
- PHP: The last layer of the LAMP stack is the programming language. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language that sits on this layer and has the role of combining all the elements of the LAMP stack. It allows web applications to run efficiently. The PHP language works with Apache to build dynamic web pages. Developers cannot use HTML alone to execute dynamic processes. It needs a programming language such as PHP to pull data out of a database. PHP executed this functionality by simply integrating PHP code into the parts of a page that needs to be dynamic. Note: PHP programming language is an efficient language. However, using the LAMP stack, developers can swap out PHP in favor of Perl or the increasingly favorite 

### How it Works?
Let us examine how these four layers interoperate using the high-level examination. The process starts when the Apache web server receives requests for web pages via a user’s browser.

For example, if the request is for a PHP file, then Apache passes the request to PHP. Next, it loads the file and executes the code. Meanwhile, PHP communicates with MySQL to fetch any data referenced in the code. 

After that, PHP uses the code in the file and the data from the database. The browsers need this to create the HTML that browsers require to display web pages. The LAMP stack can handle both static web pages and dynamic pages. Dynamic means the contents keep on changing depending on the date, time, user identity, etc. 

After running the file code, PHP passes the resulting data back to the Apache web server, then sends it to the browser. During this process, it stores new data in MySQL. This interconnectivity is made possible by the Linux operating system running at the base of the stack. 

### Developer’s Benefits
So, why would developers choose the LAMP stack over other tech stacks?

Here are some benefits to consider:
- LAMP stack consists of Free and Open-source Software (FOSS), making them readily available.
- FOSS offers little restrictions on its usage and involves no license fees.
- Developers have easy access to their community support, making it easier to fix bugs and issues.
- Simplifies the software development process and supplies flexibility compared to any enterprise commercial-based products.

### CHMOD
The chmod, or change mode, command allows an administrator to set or modify a file’s permissions. Every UNIX file has an owner user and an owner group attached to it, and every file has permissions associated with it. The permissions are as follows: read, write, or execute.

UNIX systems have many users. In this context, a user may refer to an individual or a system operation. UNIX identifies each user with a UID, and users may be organized into groups.

The syntax of the chmod command is:
chmod mode file
Example:
chmod 720 readme.txt

Each number in the mode parameter represents the permissions for a user or group of users:
- The first number represents the file’s owner
- The second number represents the file’s group
- The third number represents everyone else

Table 1 shows the eight numbers that can be used within the chmod parameter. The rwx column specifies read, write, and execute access, offering a binary value for each operation. A "1" means "yes," a "0" means "no." If rwx reads 110, then that permission may read and write, but not execute.
|   #    |   Permission   |  rwx   |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  0 |   none                    |   000     |
| 1  |   Execute only            |   001     |
| 2  |   Write only              |   010     |
| 3  |   Write and execute       |   011     |
| 4  |   Read only               |   100     |
| 5  |   Read and execute        |   101     |
| 6  |   Read and write          |   110     |
| 7  |   Read, write and execute |   111     |

### CHOWN
The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link. In Linux, all files are associated with an owner and a group and assigned with permission access rights for the file owner, the group members, and others. 

### How to Use chown
The chown command expressions take the following form:
USER is the username or the user ID (UID) of the new owner. GROUP is the name of the new group or the group ID (GID). FILE(s) is the name of one or more files, directories or links. Numeric IDs should be prefixed with the + symbol.
- USER - If only the user is specified, the specified user will become the owner of the given files, the group ownership is not changed.
- USER: - When the username is followed by a colon: and the group name is not given, the user will become the owner of the files, and the files group ownership is changed to user’s login group.
- USER: GROUP - If both the user and the group are specified (with no space between them), the user ownership of the files is changed to the given user and the group ownership is changed to the given group. : GROUP - If the User is omitted and the group is prefixed with a colon: only the group ownership of the files is changed to the given group
- : If only a colon is given, without specifying the user and the group, no change is made.

By default, on success, chown doesn’t produce any output and returns zero.
Use the ls -l command to find out who owns a file or what group the file belongs to:
$ ls -l filename.txt

Normal users can change the group of the file only if they own the file and only to a group of which they are a member. Administrative users can change the group ownership of all files.

## Welcome to my very first devops series Projects

I am  really excited to start getting my hands dirty. There is a lot of projects ahead, so without any delay, let's get started.

As you kick off your career in DevOps, you will soon realise that everything you will be doing as a DevOps engineer is around software, websites, applications etc. And, there are different stack of technologies that make different solutions possible. These stack of technologies are regarded as WEB STACKS. Examples of Web Stacks include LAMP, LEMP, MEAN, and MERN stacks. As you proceed in your journey, you will be required to understand and implement all of these technology stacks. Lets have a short close up on what a Technology stack is.

### What is a Technology stack?
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. They are acronymns for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. some examples are:
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

**WARNING**: Most of the things you will be doing at the early days may not mean a lot to you. Sometimes it may seem like you are just copying and pasting. That is absolutely fine. We want some concepts to begin to register in your sub-conscious mind, and without you realising it, you are building up skills. although, there are certain traps that will require you to troubleshoot along the way. So watch out for them in all your project implementations.

Being able to work with Linux requires the ability to work outside the level of your present knowledge. It means that in the real world, you will be faced with tasks that you have never worked on before, and with Google search and its results, you can achieve a lot. Thanks to “Google!!!”. It is one of the essential skills you will need to develop - constructing a correct search query for Google to process and having the ability to comb through resources that interpretes into a potential solution for you is a great skill to have as well.

###  Preparing prerequisites
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

AWS is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage for our projects.

Do not focus too much on AWS itself right now, there will be a proper Cloud introduction and configuration projects later in our course.

Right now, all we need to know is that AWS can provide us with a free virtual server called EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for our needs.

Spinning up a new EC2 instance (an instance of a virtual server) is only a matter of a few clicks.
You can either Watch the videos below to get yourself set up.
- AWS account setup and Provisioning an Ubuntu Server
- Connecting to your EC2 Instance

Or follow the instructions below:
- Register a new AWS account following this instruction.
- Select your preferred region (the closest to you) and launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM)

Register a new AWS account 

![](./images/aws.png)

Launch an EC2 Instance

![](./images/ec3.png)
![](./images/ec4.png)
![](./images/ec5.png)
![](./images/ec6.png)
![](./images/ec7.png)

Connect to your EC2 Instance

![](./images/connect.png)

IMPORTANT - save your private key (.pem file) securely and do not share it with anyone! If you lose it, you will not be able to connect to your server ever again!

For Windows users, you will need a tool called putty to connect to your EC2 Instance. Download Putty [Here](https://www.putty.org/).

For Mac users, you can simply open up Terminal and use the ssh command to get into the server.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** - Both Putty and ssh use the SSH protocol to establish connectivity between computers. It is the most secure protocol because it uses crypto algorithms to encrypt the data that is transmitted - it uses TCP port 22 which is open for all newly created EC2 intances in AWS by default. Most of these terminologies will make more sense to you as you proceed. So for now, if nothing makes sense, just ignore. But be assured that the information is already registered in your sub-conscious mind. So it will become useful to you soon.

The process to connect to the virtual server is different between Windows and Mac. So lets take a quick tour.

(Windows) - Connecting to EC2 using Putty
Remember the private key your downloaded from AWS while provisioning the server? It is a PEM file format. You can open it up to see the content and have a glimpse of what a PEM file looks like. Since Putty does not support .pem files - we must convert our private key (PEM format) into another file format called .ppk. We will need another tool to do that - using [PuttyGen](https://www.puttygen.com/)

Here is how to do the conversion

![](./images/puttygen.gif)

Convert .pem to .ppk

Once the conversion is complete and we have our .ppk file that Putty supports, we have everything we need to connect to our EC2 instance. Here is our checklist below.

- [x] Public IP address
- [x] ‘ubuntu’ as user
- [x] .ppk private key file

**Retrieve the Public IP address to your instance.**

![](./images/ip.png)

Copy EC2 Public IP address

**Paste the public IP, load the private key and connect.**
![](./images/public-ip.gif)

Connect to EC2 via Putty

(Macbook) Connecting to EC2 using the terminal

- The terminal is already installed by default. You just need to open it up.
- You do not need to convert to a .ppk file. Just use the same key as downloaded from AWS.
- Change directory into the loacation where your PEM file is. Most likely will be in the Downloads folder

```
cd ~/Downloads
```

**IMPORTANT**- Anywhere you see these anchor tags < > , going forward, it means you will need to replace the content in there with values specific to your situation. For example, if we need you to replace the name you have saved the private key on your machine, we will write something like **< private-key-name >**.

If the private key you downloaded was named my-private-key.pem simply remove the anchor tags and insert my-private-key.pem in the command you are required to execute. Lets try this and follow the instructions below to get some work done.

Change premissions for the private key file (.pem), otherwise you can get an error “Bad permissions”

```
sudo chmod 0400 <private-key-name>.pem
```

Connect to the instance by running

```
ssh -i <private-key-name>.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP-address>
```
![](./images/connect.png)

Congratulations! You have just created your very first Linux Server in the Cloud and our set up looks like this now: (You are the client)

![](./images/aws-ec2.png)

Please read information about AWS [free tier limits](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) and make sure that you ***STOP*** your EC2 instance when you are not using it.

![](./images/stopEC2.png)

All i need to know right now is that i can use 750 hours (31.25 days) of t2.micro server per month for the first 12 months **FOR FREE.**

You can launch and stop new instances when you need to, but by default there is a soft-limit of maximum 5 running instances at the same time. In my first project i will be using only 1 running instance at a time. When you stop an instance - it stops consuming available hours.

Note that every time you stop and start your EC2 instance - you will have a new IP address, it is normal behavior, so do not forget to update your SSH credentials when you try to connect to your EC2 server.

Let us move on and configure our EC2 machine to serve a Web server!

**Installing Apache and Updating the Firewall**

What exactly is Apache?

[Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software. However, websites and other applications can run on other web server software as well. Such as [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [Microsoft’s IIS](https://www.iis.net/), etc.

The Apache web server is among the most popular web servers in the world. It’s well documented, has an active community of users, and has been in wide use for much of the history of the web, which makes it a great default choice for hosting a website.

Install Apache using Ubuntu’s package manager [***‘apt’***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)):

```
#update a list of packages in package manager
$ sudo apt update
#run apache2 package installation
$ sudo apt install apache2
```
![](./images/apache.png)
![](./images/apache1.png)

To verify that apache2 is running as a Service in our OS, use following command
```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
![](./images/verify.png)

If it is green and running, then you did everything correctly - you have just launched your first Web Server in the Clouds!

Before we can receive any traffic by our Web Server, we need to
- Open TCP port 80 which is the default port that web browsers use to access web pages on the Internet
- Enable the ufw ([uncomplicated firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall))
- And, allow Apache traffic through the firewall.

As we know, we have TCP port 22 open by default on our EC2 machine to access it via SSH, so we need to add a rule to EC2 configuration to open inbound connection through port 80:
![](./images/port80.gif)
![](./images/port.png)

Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the Internet (Source 0.0.0.0/0 means ‘from any IP address’).

Now, let’s enable the firewall on the server:
```
sudo ufw enable
```

Allow Apache traffic
```
sudo ufw allow "Apache"
```
First, let us try to check how we can access it locally in our Ubuntu shell, run:
```
$ curl http://localhost:80
or
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:80
```

These 2 commands above actually do pretty much the same - they use ‘curl’ command to request our Apache HTTP Server on port 80 (actually you can even try to not specify any port - it will work anyway). The difference is that: in the first case we try to access our server via DNS name and in the second one - by IP address (in this case IP address 127.0.0.1 corresponds to DNS name ‘localhost’ and the process of converting a DNS name to IP address is called “resolution”). We will touch DNS in further lectures and projects.

As an output you can see some strangely formatted test, do not worry, we just made sure that our Apache web service responds to ‘curl’ command with some payload.

Now it is time for us to test how our Apache HTTP server can respond to requests from the Internet. Open a web browser of your choice and try to access following url

```
http://<Public-IP-Address>:80
```

Another way to retrieve your Public IP address, other than to check it in AWS Web console, is to use following command:
```
curl -s http://18.191.53.69:80/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```
The URL in browser shall also work if you do not specify port number since all web browsers use port 80 by default.

If you see following page, then your web server is now correctly installed and accessible through your firewall.

![](./images/apache-final.png)

In fact, it is the same content that you previously got by ‘curl’ command, but represented in nice [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) formatting by your web browser.

**Installing MySQL**

Now that you have a web server up and running, you need to install a [Database Management System (DBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database#Database_management_system) to be able to store and manage data for your site in a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is a popular relational database management system used within PHP environments, so we will use it in our project.

Again, use ‘apt’ to acquire and install this software:
```
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

![](./images/mysql.png)

When prompted, confirm installation by typing <span style="color:red">Y </span>, and then <span style="color:red">ENTER </span>.

When the installation is finished, it’s recommended that you run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. Start the interactive script by running:
```
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
![](./images/secure.png)

This will ask if you want to configure the <span style="color:red">VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN </span>.

```
VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No:
```

If you answer “yes”, you’ll be asked to select a level of password validation. Keep in mind that if you enter <span style="color:red">2 </span> for the strongest level, you will receive errors when attempting to set any password which does not contain numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and special characters, or which is based on common dictionary words.

```
There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary              file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 1
```

Regardless of whether you chose to set up the  <span style="color:red">VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN </span>, your server will next ask you to select and confirm a password for the MySQL **root** user. This is not to be confused with the **system root**. The **database root** user is an administrative user with full privileges over the database system. Even though the default authentication method for the MySQL root user dispenses the use of a password, **even when one is set**, you should define a strong password here as an additional safety measure. We’ll talk about this in a moment.

If you enabled password validation, you’ll be shown the password strength for the root password you just entered and your server will ask if you want to continue with that password. If you are happy with your current password, enter <span style="color:red">Y </span> for “yes” at the prompt:

```
Estimated strength of the password: 100 
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
```

For the rest of the questions, press <span style="color:red">Y </span> and hit the  <span style="color:red">ENTER </span> key at each prompt. This will remove some anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes you have made.

When you’re finished, test if you’re able to log in to the MySQL console by typing:
```
$ sudo mysql
```

![](./images/sudo.png)

This will connect to the MySQL server as the administrative database user **root**, which is inferred by the use of sudo when running this command. You should see output like this:

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 11
Server version: 8.0.22-0ubuntu0.20.04.3 (Ubuntu)

Copyright (c) 2000, 2020, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> 
```

To exit the MySQL console, type:
```
mysql> exit
```

Notice that you didn’t need to provide a password to connect as the **root** user, even though you have defined one when running the <span style="color:red">mysql_secure_installation </span> script. That is because the default authentication method for the administrative MySQL user is <span style="color:red">unix_socket </span> instead of <span style="color:red">password </span>. Even though this might look like a security concern at first, it makes the database server more secure because the only users allowed to log in as the root MySQL user are the system users with sudo privileges connecting from the console or through an application running with the same privileges. In practical terms, that means you won’t be able to use the administrative database root user to connect from your PHP application. Setting a password for the root MySQL account works as a safeguard, in case the default authentication method is changed from <span style="color:red">unix_socket </span> to <span style="color:red">password </span>.

For increased security, it’s best to have dedicated user accounts with less expansive privileges set up for every database, especially if you plan on having multiple databases hosted on your server.

**Note**: At the time of this writing, the native MySQL PHP library <span style="color:red">mysqlnd </span> doesn’t support <span style="color:red">caching_sha2_authentication </span>, the default authentication method for MySQL 8. For that reason, when creating database users for PHP applications on MySQL 8, you’ll need to make sure they’re configured to use  <span style="color:red">mysql_native_password </span>instead.

Your MySQL server is now installed and secured. Next, we will install PHP, the final component in the LAMP stack.

 **Installing PHP**

 You have Apache installed to serve your content and MySQL installed to store and manage your data. [PHP](https://www.php.net/) is the component of our setup that will process code to display dynamic content to the end user. In addition to the <span style="color:red">php </span> package, you’ll need <span style="color:red">php-mysql </span>, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases. You’ll also need <span style="color:red">libapache2-mod-php </span> to enable Apache to handle PHP files. Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies.

To install these 3 packages at once, run:
```
$ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```
![](./images/php.png)

Once the installation is finished, you can run the following command to confirm your PHP version:

```
php -v
```

```
PHP 7.4.3 (cli) (built: Oct  6 2020 15:47:56) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
```

At this point, your LAMP stack is completely installed and fully operational.

- [x] Linux (Ubuntu)
- [x] Apache HTTP Server
- [x] MySQL
- [x] PHP

To test your setup with a PHP script, it’s best to set up a proper [Apache Virtual Host](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/) to hold your website’s files and folders. Virtual host allows you to have multiple websites located on a single machine and users of the websites will not even notice it.

![](./images/host.png)

**Creating a Virtual Host for your Website using Apache**
In this project, you will set up a domain called <span style="color:red">projectlamp </span>, but you can replace this with any domain of your choice.

Apache on Ubuntu 20.04 has one server block enabled by default that is configured to serve documents from the **/var/www/html** directory. We will leave this configuration as is and will add our own directory next next to the default one.

Create the directory for <span style="color:red">projectlamp </span> using **‘mkdir’** command as follows:
```
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/projectlamp
```

Next, assign ownership of the directory with the <span style="color:red">$USER </span> environment variable, which will reference your current system user:
```
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectlamp
```

Then, create and open a new configuration file in Apache’s <span style="color:red">sites-available </span> directory using your preferred command-line editor. Here, we’ll be using <span style="color:red">vi </span> or <span style="color:red">vim </span> (They are the same by the way):
```
$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/projectlamp.conf
```

This will create a new blank file. Paste in the following bare-bones configuration by hitting on  or <span style="color:red">i </span> on the keyboard to enter the insert mode, and paste the text:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName projectlamp
    ServerAlias www.projectlamp 
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

To save and close the file, simply follow the steps below:
```
1.Hit the esc button on the keyboard
2.Type :
3.Type wq. w for write and q for quit
4.Hit ENTER to save the file
```

You can use the <span style="color:red">ls </span> command to show the new file in the sites-available directory

```
$ sudo ls /etc/apache2/sites-available
You will see something like this
000-default.conf  default-ssl.conf  projectlamp.conf
```

With this VirtualHost configuration, we’re telling Apache to serve <span style="color:red">projectlamp </span> using **/var/www/projectlampl** as its web root directory. If you would like to test Apache without a domain name, you can remove or comment out the options ServerName and ServerAlias by adding a # character in the beginning of each option’s lines. Adding the # character there will tell the program to skip processing the instructions on those lines.

You can now use **a2ensite** command to enable the new virtual host:
```
$ sudo a2ensite projectlamp
```

You might want to disable the default website that comes installed with Apache. This is required if you’re not using a custom domain name, because in this case Apache’s default configuration would overwrite your virtual host. To disable Apache’s default website use **a2dissite** command , type:
```
$ sudo a2dissite 000-default
```

To make sure your configuration file doesn’t contain syntax errors, run:
```
$ sudo apache2ctl configtest
```

Finally, reload Apache so these changes take effect:

```
$ sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Your new website is now active, but the web root **/var/www/projectlamp** is still empty. Create an index.html file in that location so that we can test that the virtual host works as expected:

```
sudo echo 'Hello LAMP from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectlamp/index.html
```

Now go to your browser and try to open your website URL using IP address:
```
http://<Public-IP-Address>:80
```

If you see the text from **‘echo’** command you wrote to index.html file, then it means your Apache virtual host is working as expected. In the output you will see your server’s public hostname (DNS name) and public IP address. You can also access your website in your browser by public DNS name, not only by IP - try it out, the result must be the same (port is optional)
```
http://<Public-DNS-Name>:80
```

You can leave this file in place as a temporary landing page for your application until you set up an <span style="color:red">index.php </span> file to replace it. Once you do that, remember to remove or rename the <span style="color:red">index.html </span> file from your document root, as it would take precedence over an <span style="color:red">index.php </span> file by default.

**Enable PHP on the website**

With the default DirectoryIndex settings on Apache, a file named <span style="color:red">index.html </span> will always take precedence over an <span style="color:red">index.php </span> file. This is useful for setting up maintenance pages in PHP applications, by creating a temporary <span style="color:red">index.html </span> file containing an informative message to visitors. Because this page will take precedence over the <span style="color:red">index.php </span> page, it will then become the landing page for the application. Once maintenance is over, the <span style="color:red">index.html </span> is renamed or removed from the document root, bringing back the regular application page.

In case you want to change this behavior, you’ll need to edit the **/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf** file and change the order in which the **index.php** file is listed within the **DirectoryIndex** directive:

```
sudo vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
```

```
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
        #Change this:
        #DirectoryIndex index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
        #To this:
        DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>
```

After saving and closing the file, you will need to reload Apache so the changes take effect:
```
$ sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Finally, we will create a PHP script to test that PHP is correctly installed and configured on your server.

Now that you have a custom location to host your website’s files and folders, we’ll create a PHP test script to confirm that Apache is able to handle and process requests for PHP files.

Create a new file named <span style="color:red">index.php </span>  inside your custom web root folder:
```
$ vim /var/www/projectlamp/index.php
```

This will open a blank file. Add the following text, which is valid PHP code, inside the file:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
```

When you are finished, save and close the file, refresh the page and you will see a page similar to this:
