# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

What is the software development life cycle?
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model and Agile model.
- Waterfall Model: This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.
- Agile Model: The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
- Spiral Model: The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is like the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.

### How the SDLC Works
SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.

Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you must ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.

### Benefits of the SDLC
SDLC done right can allow the highest level of management control and documentation. Developers understand what they should build and why. All parties agree on the goal upfront and see a clear plan for arriving at that goal. Everyone understands the costs and resources required.

Several pitfalls can turn an SDLC implementation into more of a roadblock to development than a tool that helps us. Failure to consider the needs of customers and all users and stakeholders can result in a poor understanding of the system requirements at the outset. The benefits of SDLC only exist if the plan is followed faithfully.

### LAMP stack
LAMP is known for its free and open-source approach to back-end development. It has Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP. Besides PHP, developers can also use Python and Perl as an alternative.

Developers choose the LAMP stack because of ease of deployment and customization. Also, it has large community support that can cater to any types or kinds of web applications. Not to mention, it works as an alternative to costly software packages and enterprises.

As a result, it is the most popular architecture on the web. LAMP architecture is behind widely known Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Therefore, if you are working with one of these popular CMS, you are using the LAMP stack on your Virtual Private Server (VPS) or dedicated server.

### LAMP’s Architecture
- Linux: Linux is the operating system and sits as the first layer of the LAMP stack. It is the backbone, as all other components run on top of it. Also, the programming language and database management used in developing an application must coincide with what platform to use. In this case, PHP, and MySQL work efficiently with Linux. On the other hand, SQL, ASP.NET, and ASP are better suited to Windows. Linux has an extensive worldwide user base that extends across different industries. Although developers can work with the rest of the stack components on different operating systems, Linux still dominates because of its flexibility and easy configuration options compared to other operating systems.
- Apache: Apache web server is the most widely used server in the world. It serves more than half of the websites on the Internet. Apache offers extensive support with its well-developed community. It works using the HTTP to process requests and send information over the Internet. Developers choose Apache for its mature and feature-rich ecosystem. Although there are other entrants such as NGINX, the choice depends on the application’s requirements. 
- MySQL: The third layer of the LAMP stack is the MySQL database. It is an open source relational database management system that stores application data. With MySQL, it stores all the information in a format that is easily queried using the SQL language. SQL language works well with a structured business domain. Also, MySQL is robust and proven suitable for running large and complex websites. It supports SQL and relational tables. By doing so, it enables developers to build dynamic enterprise-level databases.
- PHP: The last layer of the LAMP stack is the programming language. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language that sits on this layer and has the role of combining all the elements of the LAMP stack. It allows web applications to run efficiently. The PHP language works with Apache to build dynamic web pages. Developers cannot use HTML alone to execute dynamic processes. It needs a programming language such as PHP to pull data out of a database. PHP executed this functionality by simply integrating PHP code into the parts of a page that needs to be dynamic. Note: PHP programming language is an efficient language. However, using the LAMP stack, developers can swap out PHP in favor of Perl or the increasingly favorite 

### How it Works?
Let us examine how these four layers interoperate using the high-level examination. The process starts when the Apache web server receives requests for web pages via a user’s browser.

For example, if the request is for a PHP file, then Apache passes the request to PHP. Next, it loads the file and executes the code. Meanwhile, PHP communicates with MySQL to fetch any data referenced in the code. 

After that, PHP uses the code in the file and the data from the database. The browsers need this to create the HTML that browsers require to display web pages. The LAMP stack can handle both static web pages and dynamic pages. Dynamic means the contents keep on changing depending on the date, time, user identity, etc. 

After running the file code, PHP passes the resulting data back to the Apache web server, then sends it to the browser. During this process, it stores new data in MySQL. This interconnectivity is made possible by the Linux operating system running at the base of the stack. 

### Developer’s Benefits
So, why would developers choose the LAMP stack over other tech stacks?

Here are some benefits to consider:
- LAMP stack consists of Free and Open-source Software (FOSS), making them readily available.
- FOSS offers little restrictions on its usage and involves no license fees.
- Developers have easy access to their community support, making it easier to fix bugs and issues.
- Simplifies the software development process and supplies flexibility compared to any enterprise commercial-based products.

### CHMOD
The chmod, or change mode, command allows an administrator to set or modify a file’s permissions. Every UNIX file has an owner user and an owner group attached to it, and every file has permissions associated with it. The permissions are as follows: read, write, or execute.

UNIX systems have many users. In this context, a user may refer to an individual or a system operation. UNIX identifies each user with a UID, and users may be organized into groups.

The syntax of the chmod command is:
chmod mode file
Example:
chmod 720 readme.txt

Each number in the mode parameter represents the permissions for a user or group of users:
- The first number represents the file’s owner
- The second number represents the file’s group
- The third number represents everyone else

Table 1 shows the eight numbers that can be used within the chmod parameter. The rwx column specifies read, write, and execute access, offering a binary value for each operation. A "1" means "yes," a "0" means "no." If rwx reads 110, then that permission may read and write, but not execute.
|   #    |   Permission   |  rwx   |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  0 |   none                    |   000     |
| 1  |   Execute only            |   001     |
| 2  |   Write only              |   010     |
| 3  |   Write and execute       |   011     |
| 4  |   Read only               |   100     |
| 5  |   Read and execute        |   101     |
| 6  |   Read and write          |   110     |
| 7  |   Read, write and execute |   111     |

### CHOWN
The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link. In Linux, all files are associated with an owner and a group and assigned with permission access rights for the file owner, the group members, and others. 

### How to Use chown
The chown command expressions take the following form:
USER is the username or the user ID (UID) of the new owner. GROUP is the name of the new group or the group ID (GID). FILE(s) is the name of one or more files, directories or links. Numeric IDs should be prefixed with the + symbol.
- USER - If only the user is specified, the specified user will become the owner of the given files, the group ownership is not changed.
- USER: - When the username is followed by a colon: and the group name is not given, the user will become the owner of the files, and the files group ownership is changed to user’s login group.
- USER: GROUP - If both the user and the group are specified (with no space between them), the user ownership of the files is changed to the given user and the group ownership is changed to the given group. : GROUP - If the User is omitted and the group is prefixed with a colon: only the group ownership of the files is changed to the given group
- : If only a colon is given, without specifying the user and the group, no change is made.

By default, on success, chown doesn’t produce any output and returns zero.
Use the ls -l command to find out who owns a file or what group the file belongs to:
$ ls -l filename.txt

Normal users can change the group of the file only if they own the file and only to a group of which they are a member. Administrative users can change the group ownership of all files.

## Welcome to my very first devops series Projects

I am  really excited to start getting my hands dirty. There is a lot of projects ahead, so without any delay, let's get started.

As you kick off your career in DevOps, you will soon realise that everything you will be doing as a DevOps engineer is around software, websites, applications etc. And, there are different stack of technologies that make different solutions possible. These stack of technologies are regarded as WEB STACKS. Examples of Web Stacks include LAMP, LEMP, MEAN, and MERN stacks. As you proceed in your journey, you will be required to understand and implement all of these technology stacks. Lets have a short close up on what a Technology stack is.

### What is a Technology stack?
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. They are acronymns for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. some examples are:
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

**WARNING**: Most of the things you will be doing at the early days may not mean a lot to you. Sometimes it may seem like you are just copying and pasting. That is absolutely fine. We want some concepts to begin to register in your sub-conscious mind, and without you realising it, you are building up skills. although, there are certain traps that will require you to troubleshoot along the way. So watch out for them in all your project implementations.

Being able to work with Linux requires the ability to work outside the level of your present knowledge. It means that in the real world, you will be faced with tasks that you have never worked on before, and with Google search and its results, you can achieve a lot. Thanks to “Google!!!”. It is one of the essential skills you will need to develop - constructing a correct search query for Google to process and having the ability to comb through resources that interpretes into a potential solution for you is a great skill to have as well.

###  Preparing prerequisites
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

AWS is the biggest Cloud Service Provider and it offers a free tier account that we are going to leverage for our projects.

Do not focus too much on AWS itself right now, there will be a proper Cloud introduction and configuration projects later in our course.

Right now, all we need to know is that AWS can provide us with a free virtual server called EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for our needs.

Spinning up a new EC2 instance (an instance of a virtual server) is only a matter of a few clicks.
You can either Watch the videos below to get yourself set up.
- AWS account setup and Provisioning an Ubuntu Server
- Connecting to your EC2 Instance

Or follow the instructions below:
- Register a new AWS account following this instruction.
- Select your preferred region (the closest to you) and launch a new EC2 instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM)

Register a new AWS account

![](./images/ec7.png)

Connect to your EC2 Instance

![](./images/connect.png)

IMPORTANT - save your private key (.pem file) securely and do not share it with anyone! If you lose it, you will not be able to connect to your server ever again!

For Windows users, you will need a tool called putty to connect to your EC2 Instance. Download Putty [Here](https://www.putty.org/).

For Mac users, you can simply open up Terminal and use the ssh command to get into the server.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** - Both Putty and ssh use the SSH protocol to establish connectivity between computers. It is the most secure protocol because it uses crypto algorithms to encrypt the data that is transmitted - it uses TCP port 22 which is open for all newly created EC2 intances in AWS by default. Most of these terminologies will make more sense to you as you proceed. So for now, if nothing makes sense, just ignore. But be assured that the information is already registered in your sub-conscious mind. So it will become useful to you soon.

The process to connect to the virtual server is different between Windows and Mac. So lets take a quick tour.

(Windows) - Connecting to EC2 using Putty
Remember the private key your downloaded from AWS while provisioning the server? It is a PEM file format. You can open it up to see the content and have a glimpse of what a PEM file looks like. Since Putty does not support .pem files - we must convert our private key (PEM format) into another file format called .ppk. We will need another tool to do that - using [PuttyGen](https://www.puttygen.com/)

Here is how to do the conversion

![](./images/puttygen.gif)

Convert .pem to .ppk

Once the conversion is complete and we have our .ppk file that Putty supports, we have everything we need to connect to our EC2 instance. Here is our checklist below.

- [x] Public IP address
- [x] ‘ubuntu’ as user
- [x] .ppk private key file

Retrieve the Public IP address to your instance.
