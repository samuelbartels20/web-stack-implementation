## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

What is the software development life cycle?
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model and Agile model.
- Waterfall Model: This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.
- Agile Model: The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
