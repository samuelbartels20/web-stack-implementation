## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:

- Requirement analysis
- Planning
- Software design such as architectural design
- Software development
- Testing
- Deployment

What is the software development life cycle?
SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use.

The SDLC involves six phases as explained in the introduction. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model and Agile model.
- Waterfall Model: This SDLC model is the oldest and most straightforward. With this methodology, we finish one phase and then start the next. Each phase has its own mini-plan and each phase “waterfalls” into the next. The biggest drawback of this model is that small details left incomplete can hold up the entire process.
- Agile Model: The Agile SDLC model separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version.
- Spiral Model: The most flexible of the SDLC models, the spiral model is like the iterative model in its emphasis on repetition. The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and test phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass.

### How the SDLC Works
SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies.

Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of analysis, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end-user or client for feedback, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

It’s also important to know that there is a strong focus on the testing phase. As the SDLC is a repetitive methodology, you must ensure code quality at every cycle. Many organizations tend to spend few efforts on testing while a stronger focus on testing can save them a lot of rework, time, and money. Be smart and write the right types of tests.

### Benefits of the SDLC
SDLC done right can allow the highest level of management control and documentation. Developers understand what they should build and why. All parties agree on the goal upfront and see a clear plan for arriving at that goal. Everyone understands the costs and resources required.

Several pitfalls can turn an SDLC implementation into more of a roadblock to development than a tool that helps us. Failure to consider the needs of customers and all users and stakeholders can result in a poor understanding of the system requirements at the outset. The benefits of SDLC only exist if the plan is followed faithfully.

### LAMP stack
LAMP is known for its free and open-source approach to back-end development. It has Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP. Besides PHP, developers can also use Python and Perl as an alternative.

Developers choose the LAMP stack because of ease of deployment and customization. Also, it has large community support that can cater to any types or kinds of web applications. Not to mention, it works as an alternative to costly software packages and enterprises.

As a result, it is the most popular architecture on the web. LAMP architecture is behind widely known Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Therefore, if you are working with one of these popular CMS, you are using the LAMP stack on your Virtual Private Server (VPS) or dedicated server.
